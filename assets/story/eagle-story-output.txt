Once, an eagle’s egg ended up in a chicken’s nest. The eagle hatched and grew up with the chicks, believing he was just a chicken. One day, he saw a majestic eagle soaring and felt an urge to fly. Despite the chickens’ doubts, he took a leap of faith, spread his wings, and soared like he was always meant to. The eagle realized that believing in himself set him free to reach his true potential.
